A manufacturer determines that the daily average cost of producing q units is:

C(q)  = 0.0001q^2 - 0.08q + 65 + 5000/q   where q > 0
C'(q) = 0.0002q - 0.08 - 5000/q^2
    0.0002q^3 - 0.08q^2 - 5000 = 0
    q = 500
c"(Q) = 0.0002 - 10000/q^3
    10000/q^3 = 0.0002
    q^3 = 10000/0.002
    q = 170.997597
    q > 0, minimum

Therefore, the daily minimum average cost is 500
