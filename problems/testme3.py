It is estimated that the operating rate of a major manufacturer's factories over a certain 365-day 
period is given by

f(t)  = 100 + (800t) / (t^2 + 90,000)    0 <= t <= 365
f'(t) = - 800 (t^2 - 90,000) / (t^2 + 90,000)^2 = 0
      -800 (t^2 - 90,000) = 0
      t^2 = 90,000
      t = 300 or -300,    
      t = 300 because 0 <= t <= 365
f(300) = 101.308

Thus, the manufacturing capacity operating rate was a maximum after 300 days.
